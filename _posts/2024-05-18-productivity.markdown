### **Intro**

I was not a productive person, and still think I am not one now, but I can somehow get works done in time rather than ending up wondering where all time went. Here is what I have been doing to achieve it. This article is also a reminder for myself to not stuck in the rabbit hole looking for any sliver bullet on productivity anymore. So this article is written in a style of talking to myself, please don’t feel offensive if it’s too true. 


### **Work on the right thing**

Although, this article is for productivity, but the most fundamental important start is making sure you are on the track to the destination. 

So please put the effort into planning includes determining the goal and understanding what needs to be done to get there. Nobody likes the feeling of wasting time and energy. 

In daily life, be happy. If you cannot resist to something that is not good, you generally know what outcome is but avoid facing it. Think about the result in front, hopefully it could alert you and stop.

At work, it is very straightforward, understand and confirm the expected outcome (in writing if possible).

### **Start working is the best way to beat procrastination**

> Nothing magic, just start doing.
> 

You want to do something now, so get starting. Get everything you need to get it done. Beside the necessary tools that you need, the following could also be helpful. 

- a cup of water may not be enough, so get a bottle of it; 

- a headphone if you are in a noise environment but you need to be focus;

- a phone that in focus mode (zero-notification)

Next, start a Pomodoro timer, it don’t mean much except telling you are in a focus mode now. so keep doing what you suppose to do until the time’s up. And make sure to take a break and do something fun.

Then repeat the Pomodoro timer and the above again. Pomodoro timer usually starts from 25 minutes, please don’t extend it too much in the beginning, otherwise you will feel overwhelmed and discourage very soon. Stick with a range until you are comfortable, then you may not need it anymore.  


### **Continue working with beating distraction**

> Don’t trust yourself can resist temptation, so minimize it
> 

It is easy to say than done - get into the environment that design for the purpose. Like study in a library, work in a quite room, avoid chatty people (or set Do Not Disturb in MS Teams at work). 

Although, you are unlikely in a perfect environment, the below may help you get into the zone (where distraction does not exist and time flies)

- try experiment and find a routine that helps you to the zone, such as
    - listening to music in a specific genre
    - write what you want to do and try to break it down into more manageable tasks
- then start working
- anything pop-up to you head, write it done somewhere, and get back to it later


### **Work effectively by accomplishing more in less time**

> Sleep, exercise, eating
> 

You know a better computer (high specification) can do more jobs than a normal computer. But you may not value the same to our body - the hardware. 

Human’s activities consume energy which is from eating and sleeping. Exercises help to build better quality energy, it helps with eating and sleeping.

So build a strong foundation consciously. You will gain more in long run.

> Back to the basic if you don’t know how to do one thing quicker, or stuck
> 

You want to get better in something but don’t know where to start. You try to browsing in the internet and finding the answer, you might find some are helpful. You tried and soon stuck, again and again.

It’s time to step back and ask yourself:
1.  if you are fully understanding the expected result;
2.  learn what’s happening
3.  how it gets here

If the answer for any of the above is no. Step back and try solve them one by one, then go through it again up until you are clear.

No pain no gain. Get to the foundation and build it up is the only way to achieve more and quicker.

> Doing it step by step is the most efficient method

### **Outro**

Advises are nothing until actions are taken. Set and refine your ultimate goal, do it, try it, stick with what works out and always improving.
